## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt about handling forms in JavaScript. I believe I could have achieved the same result with simpler JavaScript, but I wanted all the data served once, then CSS to handle the display.

### Continued development

I will continue to look at different ways to implement JavaScript and will come back to this project to look at different, and maybe simpler solutions.
